# Building OAuth application

You can build OAuth applications for others and yourself to use. Learn how to create and set up OAuth application and the authorization flow.

---

**[Create an OAuth application](/oauth-app/create)**

When your account is a developer account, you can create own OAuth applications.

**[Authorizing OAuth application](/oauth-app/authorize)**

You can enable other users to authorize your OAuth application.
        
**[Scopes for OAuth application](/oauth-app/scopes)**

Scopes let you specify exactly what type of access you need. Scopes limit access for OAuth tokens. They do not grant any additional permission beyond that which the user already has.
